# langchain_pypdf

### Aim
In this lesson, we learned about different types of PDF file loaders in Langchain. These loaders are useful because they allow us to convert our PDF file data into a document format, which makes it easier to create an index and perform queries on the data. Using PDF loaders, we can extract the text and structure from PDF files, enabling us to analyze and process the information they contain.
